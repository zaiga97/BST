\mbox{\hyperlink{classBST_1_1__iterator}{\+\_\+iterator}} is a templated class used for the pythonic for loop syntax. It only contains a raw pointer to a node as a private member and several operators to move in the tree and compare/extract informations from the node it\textquotesingle{}s pointing at. The common use is to travers the tree from the smallest key node to the biggest one.
